## 3. Data Flow Architecture

### 3.1 Monitoring Workflow
```
Configuration Manager → Monitoring Engine → Site Processor → Entity Processor → Data Store
                                    ↓                              ↓
                              Logging System                Report Generator
                                                                   ↓
                                                          Notification System
```

### 3.2 API Request Flow
```
External Client → API Gateway → Data Store → Response Processing → External Client
                      ↓
               Authentication/Authorization
                      ↓
                Logging System
```

### 3.3 Error Handling Flow
```
Any Component → Error Handler → Logging System → Monitoring Engine → Recovery Actions
                     ↓
            Notification System (for critical errors)
```

## 4. Integration Patterns

### 4.1 Component Communication
- **Synchronous**: Direct function calls within process boundaries
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues for decoupled processing
- **Event-driven**: Pub/sub pattern for change notifications
- **API-based**: REST interfaces for external integrations

### 4.2 Data Persistence Patterns
- **Transactional**: ACID compliance for critical data operations
- **Append-only**: Immutable change logs for audit trails
- **Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **Archival**: Long-term storage for historical analysis

### 4.3 Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple worker processes for site checking
- **Load balancing**: Distribute API requests across instances
- **Caching layers**: Reduce database load and improve response times
- **Asynchronous processing**: Non-blocking operations for better throughput

## 5. Security Architecture
