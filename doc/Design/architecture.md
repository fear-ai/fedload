## 4. Integration Patterns

### 4.1 Component Communication
- **Synchronous**: Direct function calls within process boundaries
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues for decoupled processing
- **Event-driven**: Pub/sub pattern for change notifications
- **API-based**: REST interfaces for external integrations

### 4.2 Data Persistence Patterns
- **Transactional**: ACID compliance for critical data operations
- **Append-only**: Immutable change logs for audit trails
- **Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **Archival**: Long-term storage for historical analysis

### 4.3 Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple worker processes for site checking
- **Load balancing**: Distribute API requests across instances
