## üì¶ Install
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd fedload
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Run API Server (for interactive checking and UI access)
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Once running, access the API documentation at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

#### Available API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Example |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Root endpoint | http://127.0.0.1:8000/ |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive API documentation | http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs |
| `/check` | GET | Check a specific FED website for changes | http://127.0.0.1:8000/check?url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/ |
| `/entities` | GET | Get all tracked entities across websites | http://127.0.0.1:8000/entities |
| `/publications` | GET | Get all tracked FED publications | http://127.0.0.1:8000/publications |
| `/config` | GET | View current configuration | http://127.0.0.1:8000/config |

> **Note:** The root endpoint (`/`) returns a simple status message. All other endpoints require specific paths as shown above.

### Run Scheduler (for automated monitoring)
```bash
python scheduler.py
```
The scheduler will:
- Check all sites based on configured frequency (default: every 30 minutes)
- Extract named entities from changed content
- Store entities in `entity_store.json`
- Generate reports based on configuration:
  - Daily reports (enabled by default)
  - Weekly summaries (disabled by default)
- Log all changes to `change_log.json`
- Apply data retention policies for logs and reports

## üì§ Data Files
- `config.json` - Configuration settings for scheduling, monitoring, and entity recognition
- `tracked_sites.json` - List of URLs to monitor
- `change_log.json` - History of detected changes
- `entity_store.json` - Accumulated named entities
- `daily_report.html` - Web-ready change report
- `weekly_summary.html` - Weekly aggregated statistics (if enabled)
- `fed_entities.json` - Knowledge base of FED officials, organizations, and publications

}
```

This enhanced entity recognition:
- Provides rich context for detected entities
- Supports relationship mapping between people, organizations, and publications
- Enables more accurate classification of content changes
- Allows tracking of specific publication release cycles
- Includes event and topic tracking

## ‚úÖ Testing
To verify the system is working correctly:

1. Run the scheduler:
```bash
python scheduler.py
```

2. View initial output:
   - Check that sites are being processed in the terminal output
   - Verify `entity_store.json` is created and contains entities
   - Confirm `daily_report.html` is generated

3. Test API functionality:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to test endpoints

4. Check data retention:
   - Verify old logs and reports are automatically cleaned up
   - Confirm new data is being properly stored

## üîÑ Updates
- Added support for PDF content extraction
- Enhanced text extraction with multiple parsers
- Improved entity recognition with custom components
- Added data retention policies
- Expanded configuration options
